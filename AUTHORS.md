# AUTHORS

The Auto-Populate Fields module would not be possible without the generous contributions of code, testing, and ideas from the CTS-IT developers, the REDCap Team, and Mike Conlon, Ph.D. We would also like to acknowledge the generous support of Dr. Carl J Pepine's WARRIOR project.

We specifically want to thank our developers Tiago Bember tbembersimeao@ufl.edu, Marly Cormar marlycormar@ufl.edu, Dileep Rajput rajputd@ufl.edu, Surya Prasanna suryayalla@ufl.edu, Prasad Lanka planka@ufl.edu, Stewart Wehmeyer swehmeyer@ufl.edu, Kyle Chesney kyle.chesney@ufl.edu, and Philip Chase pbc@ufl.edu for their contributions to the project.  Taryn Stoffs tls@ufl.edu and Jerri Johnston j.johnston@ufl.edu provided valuable input into the design and testing of the Auto-Populate Fields module.
